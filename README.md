# Factortastic

## Overview
Factortastic is an engaging and educational card game designed for children. It combines fun with learning, helping kids develop their mathematical skills and strategic thinking. This repository contains the source code for the Factortastic web application, including both frontend and backend components.

## Project Structure
The project is divided into two main directories:

- **backend**: Contains the server-side code written in Node.js. It includes a Dockerfile for containerization, package management files, and the main server script.
- **frontend**: Houses the client-side code. This includes the user interface, written in HTML/CSS/JS, along with configuration files for Vite and a dedicated Dockerfile.
